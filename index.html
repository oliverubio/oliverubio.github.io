    <h#>Hi, my name is Emily Colwell.</h#>
    <p>I am an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at Tufts University. I enjoy learning and hiking. I recently hiked Mount Moosilauke and hope to hike all 48 4,000 in the White Mountains. </p>

    <p> I have made things far more complex and beautiful than this website, but recently I've been spending my time reading about cyber security, working on projects and organizing a hackathon. Hopefully someday this will be the website of my dreams, but until then, enjoy this simple website. </p>

    <h#>Leadership Experience</h#>
    <p> I run a club at Tufts University called Computer Science Exchange (CSX for short). We host events like Polyhack, tech talks, and barbecues. This year, we're hosting our first Reverse Career Fair on October 5th. I manage all club aspects from the budget to sponsor outreach and space reservation. We hope to expand our board soon!</p>

    <p>I work as a TA for a class called COMP40: Machine Structure and programming. The class focuses on C and the underlying structure of modern computers. I hold office hours and grade design documents. I enjoy teaching and have also TAed for ES02: Intro to Computing in Engineering where I led a lab.</p>
